# Internet Security
My project for CS445 - Internet Security, will be focused on embedding self-created certificates to the trusted Cas list. I will attempt to provide implementation of this functionality and a detailed report on how it works, explaining key concepts.

**To do list**
- (1) Code Implementation 
- (2) Documentation and Technical Report

**Day to Day Progress**
- 3/26/2019 - Looking into how to write a program to create a self assigned certificate to secure a given website. Research on what it takes to complete this task, and looking into sudo commands.
