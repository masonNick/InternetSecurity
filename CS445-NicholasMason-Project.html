<h1>CS445 - Internet Security Project</h1>
<h4>By: Nicholas Mason </h4>
<h4>Due: April 29th, 2019 </h4>
<p>My project for CS445 - Internet Security, will be focused on embedding self-created certificates to the trusted Cas list. I will attempt to provide implementation of this functionality and a detailed report on how it works, explaining key concepts.
